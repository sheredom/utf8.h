## Usage ##

Just `#include "utf8.h"` in your code!

The current supported platforms are Linux, macOS and Windows.

The current supported compilers are gcc, clang, MSVC's cl.exe, and clang-cl.exe.

## Design ##

The utf8.h API matches the string.h API as much as possible by design. There are a few major differences though.

utf8.h uses char8_t* in C++ 20 instead of char*

Anywhere in the string.h or strings.h documentation where it refers to 'bytes' I have changed that to utf8 codepoints. For instance, utf8len will return the number of utf8 codepoints in a utf8 string - which does not necessarily equate to the number of bytes.

## API function docs ##

```c
int utf8casecmp(const void *src1, const void *src2);
```
Return less than 0, 0, greater than 0 if `src1 < src2`, `src1 == src2`,
`src1 > src2` respectively, case insensitive.

```c
void *utf8cat(void *dst, const void *src);
```
Append the utf8 string `src` onto the utf8 string `dst`.

```c
void *utf8chr(const void *src, utf8_int32_t chr);
```
Find the first match of the utf8 codepoint `chr` in the utf8 string `src`.

```c
int utf8cmp(const void *src1, const void *src2);
```
Return less than 0, 0, greater than 0 if `src1 < src2`,   
`src1 == src2`, `src1 > src2` respectively.

```c
void *utf8cpy(void *dst, const void *src);
```
Copy the utf8 string `src` onto the memory allocated in `dst`.

```c
size_t utf8cspn(const void *src, const void *reject);
```
Number of utf8 codepoints in the utf8 string `src` that consists entirely   
of utf8 codepoints not from the utf8 string `reject`.

```c
void *utf8dup(const void *src);
```
Duplicate the utf8 string `src` by getting its size, `malloc`ing a new buffer   
copying over the data, and returning that. Or 0 if `malloc` failed.

```c
size_t utf8len(const void *str);
```
Number of utf8 codepoints in the utf8 string `str`,   
**excluding** the null terminating byte.

```c
size_t utf8nlen(const void *str, size_t n);
```
Similar to `utf8len`, except that only at most `n` bytes of `src` are looked.

```c
int utf8ncasecmp(const void *src1, const void *src2, size_t n);
```
Return less than 0, 0, greater than 0 if `src1 < src2`, `src1 == src2`,   
`src1 > src2` respectively, case insensitive. Checking at most `n`   
bytes of each utf8 string.

```c
void *utf8ncat(void *dst, const void *src, size_t n);
```
Append the utf8 string `src` onto the utf8 string `dst`,   
writing at most `n+1` bytes. Can produce an invalid utf8   
string if `n` falls partway through a utf8 codepoint.

```c
int utf8ncmp(const void *src1, const void *src2, size_t n);
```
Return less than 0, 0, greater than 0 if `src1 < src2`,   
`src1 == src2`, `src1 > src2` respectively. Checking at most `n`   
bytes of each utf8 string.

```c
void *utf8ncpy(void *dst, const void *src, size_t n);
```
Copy the utf8 string `src` onto the memory allocated in `dst`.   
Copies at most `n` bytes. If `n` falls partway through a utf8
codepoint, or if `dst` doesn't have enough room for a null
terminator, the final string will be cut short to preserve
utf8 validity.

```c
void *utf8pbrk(const void *str, const void *accept);
```
Locates the first occurrence in the utf8 string `str` of any byte in the   
utf8 string `accept`, or 0 if no match was found.

```c
void *utf8rchr(const void *src, utf8_int32_t chr);
```
Find the last match of the utf8 codepoint `chr` in the utf8 string `src`.

```c
size_t utf8size(const void *str);
```
Number of bytes in the utf8 string `str`,   
including the null terminating byte.

```c
size_t utf8size_lazy(const void *str);
```
Similar to `utf8size`, except that the null terminating byte is **excluded**.

```c
size_t utf8nsize_lazy(const void *str, size_t n);
```
Similar to `utf8size`, except that only at most `n` bytes of `src` are looked and
the null terminating byte is **excluded**.

```c
size_t utf8spn(const void *src, const void *accept);
```
Number of utf8 codepoints in the utf8 string `src` that consists entirely   
of utf8 codepoints from the utf8 string `accept`.

```c
void *utf8str(const void *haystack, const void *needle);
```
The position of the utf8 string `needle` in the utf8 string `haystack`.

```c
void *utf8casestr(const void *haystack, const void *needle);
```
The position of the utf8 string `needle` in the utf8 string `haystack`, 
case insensitive.

```c
void *utf8valid(const void *str);
```
Return 0 on success, or the position of the invalid utf8 codepoint on failure.

```c
void *utf8nvalid(const void *str, size_t n);
```
Similar to `utf8valid`, except that only at most `n` bytes of `src` are looked.

```c
int utf8makevalid(void *str, utf8_int32_t replacement);
```
Return 0 on success. Makes the `str` valid by replacing invalid sequences with
the 1-byte `replacement` codepoint.

```c
void *utf8codepoint(const void *str, utf8_int32_t *out_codepoint);
```
Sets out_codepoint to the current utf8 codepoint in `str`, and returns the
address of the next utf8 codepoint after the current one in `str`.

```c
void *utf8rcodepoint(const void *str, utf8_int32_t *out_codepoint);
```
Sets out_codepoint to the current utf8 codepoint in `str`, and returns the
address of the previous utf8 codepoint before the current one in `str`.

```c
size_t utf8codepointsize(utf8_int32_t chr);
```
Returns the size of the given codepoint in bytes.

```c
void *utf8catcodepoint(void *utf8_restrict str, utf8_int32_t chr, size_t n);
```
Write a codepoint to the given string, and return the address to the next
place after the written codepoint. Pass how many bytes left in the buffer to
n. If there is not enough space for the codepoint, this function returns
null.

```c
int utf8islower(utf8_int32_t chr);
```
Returns 1 if the given character is lowercase, or 0 if it is not.

```c
int utf8isupper(utf8_int32_t chr);
```
Returns 1 if the given character is uppercase, or 0 if it is not.

```c
void utf8lwr(void *utf8_restrict str);
```
Transform the given string into all lowercase codepoints.

```c
void utf8upr(void *utf8_restrict str);
```
Transform the given string into all uppercase codepoints.

```c
utf8_int32_t utf8lwrcodepoint(utf8_int32_t cp);
```
Make a codepoint lower case if possible.

```c
utf8_int32_t utf8uprcodepoint(utf8_int32_t cp);
```
Make a codepoint upper case if possible.

## Codepoint Case

Various functions provided will do case insensitive compares, or transform utf8
strings from one case to another. Given the vastness of unicode, and the authors
lack of understanding beyond latin codepoints on whether case means anything,
the following categories are the only ones that will be checked in case
insensitive code:

* [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Latin_(Unicode_block))
* [Latin-1 Supplement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin-1_Supplement_(Unicode_block))
* [Latin Extended-A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_Extended-A)
* [Latin Extended-B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_Extended-B)
* [Greek and Coptic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_and_Coptic)
* [Cyrillic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrillic_(Unicode_block))

## Todo ##

- Implement utf8coll (akin to strcoll).
- Implement utf8fry (akin to strfry).
- Investigate adding dst buffer sizes for utf8cpy and utf8cat to catch overwrites (as suggested by [@FlohOfWoe](https://twitter.com/FlohOfWoe) in https://twitter.com/FlohOfWoe/status/618669237771608064)
